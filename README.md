# weather-App
Overview
This project is a web-based application that displays the weather and heat index of a city in real-time. It leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The application retrieves weather data from a weather API and calculates the heat index temperature using the retrieved data.

Features
Real-Time Weather Data: The application fetches real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for a specified city.
Heat Index Calculation: The heat index (also known as the "feels-like" temperature) is calculated based on the temperature and humidity levels. This gives users a better understanding of how hot it feels.
User Interface: A responsive and visually appealing interface designed using HTML and CSS.
City Search Functionality: Users can search for any city to get its current weather and heat index.
Error Handling: The application provides feedback if the city is not found or if there are issues with retrieving the data.
